DO NOT EDIT A GAMESTATE FILE
DO NOT EDIT EXISTING TEST DATA


# CODE RULES

- The Design of the library should closely follow System.Text.Json.JsonDocument
- Writing a parser for Stellaris the .sav zipfile that contains meta and gamestate key/value files

# Reverse Engineering

- The stellaris file format is not json
- The stellaris file format is similar to valve key/value store but not identical
- The @TestData folder contains files that contain the data structures we need to support
- Implement a Lexer that understands the syntax of the Stellaris file
- There should be various TokenTypes 

# Testing

- Use the real file [original-gamestate](mdc:reverse-engineer-samples/original-gamestate) for unit testing against the real file
- do NOT use the unzippedc-chunked for testing as these files are only for reverse-engineering / looking at structure
