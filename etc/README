# PowerShell Scripts and Configuration

The `/etc` directory contains configuration files and utility scripts used for development, building, and maintaining the project. This follows the Unix-like convention of storing system-wide configuration files in `/etc`.

## Why PowerShell?

PowerShell is used across all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) in this project because:

1. It provides true cross-platform support through PowerShell Core (Pwsh)
2. Maintains a single codebase for scripts rather than maintaining separate bash and PowerShell versions
3. Offers consistent behavior across different operating systems
4. Provides rich object manipulation and .NET integration
5. Reduces maintenance overhead by avoiding platform-specific script variants

All scripts in this directory are written in PowerShell and can be executed using PowerShell Core (pwsh) on any supported platform.
